# Meta-Analysis of LLMs and Creativity

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for a meta-analysis investigating the relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and creativity.

## Repository Structure

- `Code/` - Contains all analysis scripts and code
- `Data/` - Raw and processed data used in the meta-analysis
- `Plots/` - Generated visualizations and plots
- `Submission/` - Final compiled PDF document and submission materials

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended IDE for running the analysis)
- Required R packages (will be automatically installed when running the code):
  - `metafor` - For meta-analysis computations
  - `tidyverse` - For data manipulation and visualization
  - `ggtext` - For enhanced text formatting in plots
  - `gridExtra` - For arranging multiple plots
  - `broom` - For tidying statistical models
  - `knitr` - For dynamic report generation
  - `xtable` - For creating LaTeX tables
  - `rstudioapi` - For RStudio integration

### Running the Analysis

We recommend using RStudio to run the analysis:
1. Open RStudio
2. Open the main analysis file (`Code/MetaAnalysis_LLM_Creativity.R`)
3. Run the code:
   - macOS: Select all code (âŒ˜ + A) and run
   - Windows: Select all code (Ctrl + A) and run

##  Analysis Components

The meta-analysis includes:
- Effect size calculations
- Heterogeneity analysis
- Publication bias assessment
- Moderator analyses
- Forest plots and other visualizations

##  Results

Key findings and visualizations can be found in the `Plots/` directory. The complete analysis results are compiled in the final document located in `Submission/`.
